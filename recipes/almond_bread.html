  <h2>Delightful Coconut Almond Bread.</h2>
  <div id="recipe">
  <p>
    After trying someone's coconut bread recipe that didn't turn out well, I changed the proportions, added a few new
    ingredients, and came up with this version. Delicious! It works well as muffins or bars, too. Just decrease the
    cooking time and bake until the inside is no longer gooey.

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <div id="recipe">

    <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
    <li>3 cups grated coconut</li>

  <h3>Directions</h3>
  <ul>
